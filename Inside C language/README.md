This folder contains my personal notes and lessons on the C Language, where I deepen various concepts through tutorials by Salvatore Sanfilippo (credited here) as well as my own explorations and insights. The content mixes official tutorials, class learnings, and personal studies to create a comprehensive learning path.

Many of the translations and explanations within these notes were assisted and refined using a Large Language Model (LLM), helping to improve clarity and accessibility while preserving the technical accuracy.
