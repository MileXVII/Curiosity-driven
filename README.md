## 1. Overview

This repository is a learning diary â€” a series of raw but genuine experiments.  
No marketing fluff, just **code, curiosity, and a touch of madness**.

Youâ€™ll find:
- **[BattleShip](#battleship)** â€“ the legendary game, implemented in C.
- **[Conwayâ€™s Game of Life](#conways-game-of-life)** â€“ recreating a universe in minimal code.
- **[Inside C language](#inside-c-language)** â€“ deep dives into the C programming language.

## 2. Projects

### BattleShip
A classic Command Line Interface implementation of the game. No fancy graphics â€” just shots, hits, and chaos.

ðŸ“‚ [Source code](./BattleShip)

---

### Conwayâ€™s Game of Life
Simulates Conwayâ€™s rules. From simple patterns to complex evolution â€” in just a few lines of C.

ðŸ“‚ [Source code](./GameOfLife)

---

### Inside C language
Notes, snippets, experiments, and even some glorious mistakes while exploring the depths of C.
