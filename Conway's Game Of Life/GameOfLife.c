/* Conway's Game of Life
   Conway's Game of Life is a "game" invented in 1970 by British mathematician John Conway.
   It follows very simple rules that nevertheless generate surprising results.
   Rather than a game, it's a two-dimensional universe made of cells (think of them as bits) arranged in a 2D grid (x, y).
   These grid cells can be alive/on (white, state 1), or dead/off (black, state 0).
   Each given state of the game grid evolves into the next state by applying the same simple rules to every cell.

   1) A live cell will remain alive in the next iteration if it has 2â€“3 live neighbors (out of the 8 surrounding it).
   2) A dead cell becomes alive if it has exactly 3 live neighbors.

   Note: This code is written using only knowledge acquired so far. It could definitely be improved using arrays and pointers.
   Only two pointers are used here, and their usage does not require deep understanding.
